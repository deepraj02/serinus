# Introduction

This section is about the Command Line Interface (CLI) of Serinus.

The Serinus CLI offers a series of commands that help your create, build, and run your Serinus applications.

## Installation

To install the Serinus CLI, you need to have Dart installed on your machine. If you don't have Dart installed, you can follow the instructions on the [Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

Once you have Dart installed, you can install the Serinus CLI by running the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate serinus_cli
```

## Usage

To use the Serinus CLI you just need to call the `serinus` command followed by the command you want to run.

Here is a list of the available commands:

| Command | Description | Link |
