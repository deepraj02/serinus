# Middlewares

Middlewares are functions called before the route handler. They have access to the `RequestContext` object and also to the `NextFunction` function, which is used to call the next middleware or the route handler.

Serinus middlewares, for ease of use, follow the capabilities of the Express.js middlewares so they can perform the same tasks.

::: info
To pass to the next middleware or route handler, you must call the `next` function.
:::

To create a middleware, you must extends the `Middleware` class and implement the `use` method.

```dart
import 'package:serinus/serinus.dart';

class LoggerMiddleware extends Middleware {
  @override
  Future<void> use(RequestContext context, NextFunction next) async {
    print('Request received: ${context.request.method} ${context.request.url}');
    return next();
  }
}
```

## Dependency Injection

Serinus middlewares share the same scopoe as the route handlers, so you can inject dependencies into them.
So if a dependency is availble in the route handler, it will be available in the middleware as well.

## Using Middlewares

To use a middleware, you must add it to the Module's `middlewares` list.

```dart
import 'package:serinus/serinus.dart';

class AppModule extends Module {
  
  const AppModule() : super(
    middlewares: [LoggerMiddleware()],
  );

}
```

In the example above the `LoggerMiddleware` will be called before all the route handlers in the module and in the submodules.

But you can also use a middleware in a specific route handler.

```dart
import 'package:serinus/serinus.dart';

class LoggerMiddleware extends Middleware {
  LoggerMiddleware() : super(routes: ['/']);
  
  @override
  Future<void> use(RequestContext context, NextFunction next) async {
    print('Request received: ${context.request.method} ${context.request.url}');
    return next();
  }
}
```

In the example above the `LoggerMiddleware` will be called only for the route handler that matches the `/` path.

## Blocking requests

Middlewares in Serinus can also block requests by three methods:

- Throwing an exception (This will block the execution of the following lifecycle methods)
- Not calling the `next` function (This will block the whole request)
- Calling the `next` method witha  result (This will block the whole request)

```dart
import 'package:serinus/serinus.dart';

class AuthMiddleware extends Middleware {
  AuthMiddleware() : super(routes: ['/']);
  
  @override
  Future<void> use(RequestContext context, NextFunction next) async {
    if (context.request.headers['authorization'] != 'Bearer token') {
      context.res.statusCode = 401;
      return next('Unauthorized');
    }
    return next();
  }
}
```

## Shelf Middlewares

> But what if I want to use a Shelf middleware?

No problem! You can use Shelf middlewares in Serinus as well and by doing so you can use the vast amount of middlewares available in the Shelf ecosystem.

```dart
import 'package:serinus/serinus.dart';

class UserModule extends Module {
  
  const UserModule() : super(
    middlewares: [Middleware.shelf(shelfMiddleware)], // You can also pass Shelf handlers
  );

}
```

The `Middleware.shelf` factory constructor will convert the Shelf middleware to a Serinus middleware and will be called before the route handlers in the module and in the submodules but there is a catch!

Shelf Middlewares can block the request without Serinus knowing it, so to prevent this, if you know that the Shelf middleware will block the request, you can set the `ignoreResponse` parameter to `false` to the `Middleware.shelf` factory constructor.

```dart
import 'package:serinus/serinus.dart';

class UserModule extends Module {
  
  const UserModule() : super(
    middlewares: [Middleware.shelf(shelfMiddleware, ignoreResponse: false)], // You can also pass Shelf handlers
  );

}
```
